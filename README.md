# Module-Challenge-Description
This project used HTML & CSS properties to make a marketing agencies website more accessible. The goal for website accessibility is for all users to be able to understand what the website is doing. An issue I ran into was with the <header> tag would not function properly once I changed it from div class =header. With time I'm hopeful that I will be able to better understand/read the code and can come back to this assignment and make it clean and concise.
